                    Malaysian
                    cuisine has developed over the region's history. Although the
                    modern state of Malaysia did not exist until 1963, the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far
                    back as the 1400s during the time of Malaccan Sultanate. Malaysian cuisine is a mixture of
                    various food cultures from around Malay archipelago, India, China, the Middle East, and several
                    European countries. This diverse culinary culture stems from Malaysia's diverse culture and
                    colonial past. The cuisine was developed as a melange between local and foreign. In the 15th
                    century, the region now known as Malaysia became an important passageway for maritime trade.
                    Passing through Malaysia were Arab traders who brought spices from the Middle East, as well as
                    Portuguese, Dutch, and English colonists and traders who introduced food staples such as
                    peanuts, pineapples, avocado, tomato, squash and pumpkin. During the 19th century during the
                    period of British colonial rule, many Indian and Chinese laborers were brought to Malaysia,
                    contributing to the diversity of tastes in Malaysian cuisine.</h6>

                    Being a multicultural country, Malaysians have over the years adopted each other's dishes to
                    suit the taste buds of their own culture. For instance, Malaysians of Chinese descent have
                    adapted the Indian curry, and made it more dilute and less spicy to suit their taste. Chinese
                    noodles have been crossed with Indian and Malay tastes and thus Malay fried noodles and Indian
                    fried noodles were born. Malaysians have also adapted famous dishes from neighbouring countries,
                    or those with strong cultural and religious ties, and in the absence of an established community
                    from said countries have made it completely their own, a notable example being tom yam, one of
                    Thailand's most well-known dishes.

                    After migrating south of the border, Thai tom yam takes on the visual characteristics of a
                    Malaysian Assam gravy with a flavour profile of sweet, sour and spicy. It is thickened with
                    pounded chile paste which also turns it a vivid orange-red. Tamarind is often used instead of
                    lime juice as its souring agent, and dried instead of fresh chillies are used to provide a fiery
                    kick. Malay-style tom yam soup tends to be heavily seafood-based, whereas in Chinese-style
                    eateries the broth's spiciness is toned down and usually serves as a base for noodle soup.
