                    Malaysian Chinese cuisine is derived from the culinary traditions of Chinese Malaysian immigrants
                    and their descendants, who have adapted or modified their culinary traditions under the influence of
                    Malaysian culture as well as immigration patterns of Chinese to Malaysia. The Chinese cuisine in
                    Malaysia mainly consists of Cantonese, Hokkien, Hainanese, Teochew and Hakka styles. Year after
                    year, the mixing of ingredients and meals of different cultures has started to appear and many
                    different flavours have been discovered. Even though 70% of the population is formed of Bumiputera
                    (Malay), and 23% is Chinese.Chinese food is very popular and much in request within the country.The
                    reason is that mixing vegetables, fruits, spices, sauces, etc with Chinese technique had become the
                    most preferable mixture of different cultures. The cuisine, which is based on properly cut and
                    aligned of meat with vegetables and rice.Chinese food is especially prominent in areas with
                    concentrated Chinese communities, at roadside stalls, hawker centres and kopitiam, as well as smart
                    cafes and upmarket restaurants throughout the nation. Many Chinese dishes have pork as a component
                    ingredient, but chicken is available as a substitution for Muslim customers from the wider
                    community, and some Chinese restaurants are even halal-certified. </h6>

                    Malaysian Chinese also eats vegetarian.Over 80% of Malaysian Chinese identify themselves as
                    Buddhists, and some follow a vegetarian diet at least some of the time. Some Chinese restaurants
                    offer an exclusively vegetarian menu (Chinese : 素食, 斎) featuring Chinese dishes which resemble meat
                    dishes in look and even taste, like "roast pork", fried "fish" with "skin" and "bones", and "chicken
                    drumsticks" complete with a "bone". These vegetarian restaurants are run by proprietors who abstain
                    from consumption of animal products as well as strong tasting vegetables and spices as way of life
                    for religious reasons, and are essentially vegan. The meat analogues used are often locally produced
                    as opposed to imported, and are made solely from ingredients like soy, gluten, mushrooms and tuber
                    vegetables. Buddhist vegetarian restaurants are likely to be found in areas with a high
                    concentration of Chinese, and tend to be especially busy on certain festive days where many
                    Buddhists temporarily adopt a strict vegetarian diet for at least a day.</h6>

                    Malaysian Chinese celebrate Chinese New Year every lunar year,this festivals commonly referred as
                    Spring Festival.Chinese New Year feast is one of the things that the Chinese take the most pride
                    in.Chinese New Year celebration is a time to bring families together.That's one of the reason
                    Malaysian Chinese think that reunion dinner is an important tradition.There's actually several
                    layers of symbolism at play when it comes to "lucky" Chinese New Year dishes: what the food's name
                    sounds like when said aloud, how it's prepared, and the way it's served can imbue a meal with extra
                    meaning, making it all the more special.Example of food like sweet glutinous rice cake(nian
                    gao),dumplings(jiaozi),spring rolls,steamed fish and chicken,hot pot and many other traditional
                    chinese cuisines. </h6>
