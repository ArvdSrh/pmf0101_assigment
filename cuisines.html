                    Traditional Kadazan cuisine involves mostly boiling or grilling which employs little use of oil, and
                    with locally unique modifications and nuances as well as particular usage of locally available
                    ingredients, particularly bamboo shoots, sago and fresh water fish.From simple appetizers of unripe
                    mango dressed with soy sauce and chili flakes to a variety of pickled foods collectively known as
                    noonsom, tangy and pungent flavours from souring agents or fermentation techniques is a key
                    characteristic of traditional Kadazan cooking. One of the most well known Kadazan dishes is hinava,
                    which is similar in concept to the South American ceviche.It is a salad made with pieces of raw fish
                    marinated in citrus juice, ginger, onion and other ingredients like bitter gourd and grated dried
                    bambangan seed which is similar in texture to desiccated coconut strands. This dish is sometimes
                    served in certain Sabahan restaurants which do not otherwise have a traditional Kadazan menu.

                    Malaysians love Thailand. The shopping, the sights, the hospitality, the close proximity, and of
                    course—the food. Especially the food. We are passionately obsessed with Thai cuisine for these
                    obvious reasons: it’s packed with flavours, doesn’t break the bank, and is just so darn
                    delicious.Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong aromatic components
                    and a spicy edge.Traditional Thai cuisine loosely falls into four categories: tom (boiled dishes),
                    yam (spicy salads), tam (pounded foods), and gaeng (curries). Deep-fries, stir-fries, and steamed
                    dishes derive from Chinese cooking.
