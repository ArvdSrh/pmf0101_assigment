                    Malaysian Indian cuisine, or the cooking of the ethnic Indian communities in Malaysia consists of
                    adaptations of authentic dishes from India, as well as original creations inspired by the diverse
                    food culture of Malaysia. Because the vast majority of Malaysia's Indian community are of South
                    Indian descent, and are mostly ethnic Tamils who are descendants of immigrants from a historical
                    region which consists of the modern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka's Northern Province,
                    much of Malaysian Indian cuisine is predominantly South Indian inspired in character and taste. A
                    typical Malaysian Indian dish is likely to be redolent with curry leaves, whole and powdered spice,
                    and contains fresh coconut in various forms. Ghee is still widely used for cooking, although
                    vegetable oils and refined palm oils are now commonplace in home kitchens. Before a meal it is
                    customary to wash hands as cutlery is often not used while eating, with the exception of a serving
                    spoon for each respective dish.</h6>

                    As nearly 90% of Malaysian Indians originated from South India, banana leaf is used traditionally to
                    eat food from. The banana leaf meal is famous in Malaysia.With rice at the center and different
                    accompaniments like pickle, fried meat or vegetable, papadam (Indian fries made of lentils).Mamak
                    (Indian Muslims) dishes have developed a distinctly Malaysian style. Available throughout the
                    country, the omnipresent Mamak stalls or restaurants are particularly popular among the locals as
                    they offer a wide range of food and some outlets are open 24 hours a day. A type of Indian Muslim
                    meal served buffet-style at specialist Mamak eateries is called nasi kandar (analogous to the
                    Indonesian nasi padang, where you pay for what you have actually eaten), white rice or briyani rice
                    served with other dishes of curry either with chicken, fish, beef, or mutton, and usually
                    accompanied with pickled vegetables and papadum.People of all races, religions and ages frequent
                    mamak stalls to gossip or catch a late-night football game while enjoying a cup of hot teh tarik. No
                    other eatery has quite as much cultural significance in Malaysia, save for the kopitiam.</h6>

                    Malaysian Indian celebrate Diwali(Deepavali) during the Hindu lunisolar month Kartika (between
                    mid-October and mid-November).This is a festival of lights that usually lasts for five days and one
                    of the major festivals celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some Buddhists, notably Newar
                    Buddhists. One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, Diwali symbolizes the spiritual "victory
                    of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance".During the festival,Malaysian
                    that celebrates Deepavali will prepare loads of delicious Indian cuisines for family and
                    friends.Like any other celebrations in Malaysia, Deepavali is celebrated with much zeal and
                    excitement by inviting family and friends of different races and religions for an 'open house' - a
                    common Malaysian practice where the star attraction is no other than the food, of course.Delicious
                    cuisines such as nasi biryani,banana leaf rice,nasi kandar,roti canai,tandoori chicken,butter
                    chicken to share with family and friends during the celebration.</h6>
